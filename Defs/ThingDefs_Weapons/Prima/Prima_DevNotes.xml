<!--BASE BALANCE MODIFICATIONS:
Range of touch is unaffected
Range of shorter weapons is brought down by 3 (Short = 13-25, minimum 4)
Range of medium weapons is brought down by 7 (Medium = 26-40)
Range of long weapons is brought down by 11 (Long = 41+)
ALKALI short weapons is brought down by 2, medium by 4, long by 6
Anima medium range is brought down by 6, long by 9

GROWTH TIMES:
5-20 days = fast growth time
21-40 days = normal growth
41-60 days = medium growth
61-80 days = slow growth
81-120 (max) days = extremely slow
These times do not account for soil acceleration.

MAX HEALTH:
Prima: 180
Verdant: 290

Alkali Weapons: 240
Blight: 280

Perrenial: 750
Elder: 1400

Royal: 600
Deeproot: 1000

Spore: 200
Archwood: 2000

====================

	***GENERAL NOTES***
		Each family has two variants: the basic, and the evolved
		Basic weapons will be the fastest to aquire, but will run out of health as they are used. You can use Sundrops to revitalize these.
		Evolved weapons will be fully matured weapons. They will not run out of health as they are used, but will wither away (expire) after some time. They cannot be rivitalized.
		Expiry on weapons is the following:
			Prima: 15 days (can also expire via usage)
			Verdant: 30 days

			Alkali: N/A
			Blight: 30 days

			Spore: 45 days

			Perrenial: 60 days
			Deeproot (was Elder): 120 days (2 quadrums)

			Anima: N/A
			Linkroot: 90 days

			Archwood: 300 days (5 quadrums)

		Recharing weapons is the following:
			ALL WEAPONS CAN BE RECHARGED WITH THE RARE HEARTWOOD TREE

			Prima: Sundrop
			Verdant: Sundrop

			Alkali: Sundrop
			Blight: Sundrop

			Spore: Seed Spore Extraction

			Perrenial: Can be planted to regrow back into a new perrenial weapon 50% faster
			Deeproot: Sundrop Vat or Terraroot Vat

			Anima: Sundrop Vat
			Linkroot: Terraroot Vat

====================

	***GROWTH METHODS***
		Each family has a different growth method. This is the way they are aqcuired.
		Growth methods are the following:
			Prima: pods planted at a growing zone
			Verdant: Grown at a Metamorphic Pool

			Alkaloid: selected via specific surge seed. These surge seeds are grown quickly, but the pods produce a naseous gas.
			Blight: Metamorphic Pool

			Spore: Harvested from tumors that are only produced by a specific mushroom tree. Must be planted in stone.

			Perrenial: Selected from a special surge seed that's grown inside a special tree. This tree must be cut down to produce the weapon.
			Deeproot: Grown from a Perrenial weapon that forms a new tree. This tree takes an entire year to grow.

			Anima/Royal: grown from a special pod that must be planted near an Anima tree. If Royalty is not installed, then it's simply grown from a special pod.
			Linkroot: done via operation between a pawn and a special pod. The pawn will be in a coma while this operation is done.


====================

	***	BALANCING NOTES***
		Immature weapons should follow the Makeshift random ammo feature.
		Immature weapons should lose health as they are used.
		Immature weapon health can be restored in special pools or vats.
		Immature weapons can accept new saps. However, the evolved weapon will also contain the sap.
		Multiple weapons shouldn't be acquirable from pods.

		Mature weapons have higher health
		Mature weapons will have more uses
		Mature weapons can't accept saps


		Balancing should get a rework in the Labs Update.
	 	-Prima Weapons should last longer and have their ammo reserves increased by 50-100%. Health should still be low.
		-Prima Weapons should have their growth time halved.
		-Prima Weapons should be the only weapons that can grow on normal soil.
		-Damage type should be cut for fast weapons, and stab for slow/accurate weapons.
		-Damage should further lowered down by 25-33%.
		-Prima weapons can only accept glowsap


====================

	***SAP NOTES***
		Sap is used to modify plant stats. This sap is extracted from the corresponding tree or bloom, then combined with a weapon inside a special vat. This adds new stats, and also revitalizes the plant. The effects are the following:
		-Sunsap: default, regenerates health when left alone (yellow)
		-Glowsap: quickly evolves the weapon (torch color)
		-Endosap: higher health (40-50%) and lower flammability (green)
		-Darksap: higher damage, speed, and AP (darklight color)
		-Hypersap: more shots and faster fire rate (white)
		-Deepsap: Can be planted on any growable terrain to regrow another weapon (light blue)
		-Archsap: weapon will never expire (purple)
		-Hemsap/Toxsap: projectiles inflict slight poison


====================


  ***PRIMA NOTES***
    Prima Weapons feature fast growth times.
		Prima Weapons will need to have stats knocked down once Perrenial Weapons are introduced. 
		Prima Weapons should be fall within fast growth time (5-20 days).
		Prima Weapons should reflect early-game sidearms that are above power in bows, but lower than normal guns. They should not mirror anything above Hi-Tech.
		Verdant Weapons will require 10 days + half of the original growth time. This can bypass fast growth time.
		Verdant Weapons have 50-60% more health, inflict the briar condition, and does cut damage alongside pierce.
		Most Prima weapons should not go above 150 health. Heavy is 160-200.

	Prima Turrets:
		-Spear Turret: basic turret. Slow firing, medium damage, fires two stakes at medium range. Comparable to a greatbow firing two shots at once.
		-Quill Turret: Miniturret. Very fast firing, low range, low damage. Comparable to the SMG.
		-Burst Turret: Miniturret. Slow firing, low range, high damage. Comparable to the shotgun.
		-Briar Turret: Extracted from evolved wepaons. Medium fire rate, medium range, low damage. Close stats to a normal miniturret.
